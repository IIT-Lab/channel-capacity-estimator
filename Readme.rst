Channel Capacity Estimator
==========================

The aim of this tool is to estimate information channel capacity.

Mutual information, computed as proposed by
[Kraskov et al.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305641.pdf),
is maximized over input probabilities
by means of a gradient-based stochastic optimization.
